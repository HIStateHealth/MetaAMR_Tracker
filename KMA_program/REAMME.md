# AMR Abundance Calculator

## Overview
The AMR Abundance Calculator is a Python tool designed to merge data from `.mapstat` and `.res` files, calculate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) abundance, and save the results in a CSV format. It extracts individual and total fragment counts from the `.mapstat` file and merges these with `.res` file data to perform the calculations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pandas library

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After installing Python, you can install pandas using pip:

### Example
This command merges the data from `sample.mapstat` and `sample.res`, calculates AMR abundance, and saves the output to `combined_data.csv`.
