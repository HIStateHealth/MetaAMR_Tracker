# MetaAMR_Tracker
MetaAMR-Tracker is a comprehensive metagenomics pipeline designed for tracking Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) genes and fungi genes in environmental wastewater samples.
From quality control to contig assembly and resistance gene identification, this pipeline integrates state-of-the-art tools like FastQC, MEGAHIT, MetaPhlAn, and ResFinder, 
to deliver a holistic view of the microbial resistome.

# Metagenomic Analysis Pipeline with Nextflow

## Introduction
This pipeline serves as a comprehensive solution for metagenomic data analysis. It is designed to run in a Nextflow environment, leveraging Docker containers for seamless software management. The pipeline incorporates a variety of bioinformatics tools for tasks ranging from quality control to specialized analyses like antibiotic resistance and viral identification.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have installed the following:
- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Python 3.0 or higher
- 
- All bioinformatics tools listed in the Nextflow script

## Setup
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HIStateHealth/MetaAMR_Tracker.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd [I will put my Project Directory here]
    ```

## Example Command
Here's an example command to help you get started. Replace the paths with those corresponding to your own setup.

```bash
nextflow run tracker_test_pipeline_2.nf \
--first_fastq /path/to/first_fastq_file \
--second_fastq /path/to/second_fastq_file \
--output_dir /path/to/output_directory \
--adapters /path/to/adapters_file \
--kraken2_db /path/to/kraken2_db \
--metaphlan_db /path/to/metaphlan_db \
--virsorter2_db /path/to/virsorter2_db


process VirSorter2 {
	container 'staphb/virsorter2:latest'
	publishDir "${params.output_dir}/virsorter2_output", mode: 'copy'
	// ... [rest of the code]
}
